This project focused on building a platform for students to connect with potential employers and explore job opportunities. The tech stack used includes front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building the user interface, along with back-end technologies such as Node.js and Express for server-side development. The project aimed to simplify the placement process for students by providing them with a centralized platform to access job opportunities, submit applications, and streamline the recruitment process.
