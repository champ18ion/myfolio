This project involved creating a basic Node.js authentication system using EJS templating engine, Bootstrap, and Passport for authentication. The goal was to provide a template that can be integrated into any web application to implement secure user authentication and authorization features. By leveraging the power of Passport, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js, the project solved the problem of user authentication in web development projects, ensuring that only authenticated users can access restricted content or perform authorized actions.
