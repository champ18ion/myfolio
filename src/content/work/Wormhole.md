 This project was a full M.E.R.N Stack movie app, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, along with Firebase Auth for user authentication. The project fetched movies from themoviedb API and categorized them by genre, allowing users to sign up and log in to browse and watch movies. The goal of the project was to provide an engaging movie streaming platform that resembles the popular streaming service Netflix. By leveraging the power of M.E.R.N stack and Firebase Auth, the project solved the problem of accessing a wide variety of movies and shows in one place, and provided a seamless and personalized user experience.
