As part of the CosMinder team, I collaborated with fellow developers to create visually stunning landing and blog pages using cutting-edge technologies like Next.js and Astro. Leveraging features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and custom animations, we optimized performance and created a seamless user experience. Following best practices for web design and accessibility, we delivered a high-quality product that is responsive and visually appealing on different devices. Our efforts resulted in fast-loading, immersive, and memorable pages that enhance the overall user experience on the CosMinder website.
