The goal of this mini project was to simulate an iPod user interface using a scrolling wheel, which was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The project utilized React components, state management, and event handling to create an interactive and visually appealing iPod-like interface that mimics the functionality of a real iPod. This project solved the problem of recreating the unique and nostalgic user experience of using an iPod, providing an engaging and interactive virtual iPod simulator.
