This web application was built using Vanilla JS, which refers to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks, and integrated with TheMealDB API to allow users to search for meals, view recipes, and add meals to their favorites. The project utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with API integration, to fetch and display meal data dynamically. The goal of the project was to provide a user-friendly and intuitive meal finder platform for users to explore new recipes, plan their meals, and save their favorite meals for future reference.
