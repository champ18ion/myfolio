Tenzies is an old dice based game. React Tenzies is a single-player web-based dice game built using React. The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by rolling ten dice and strategically selecting which dice to keep and which to re-roll. The game features a user-friendly interface that allows players to easily interact with the dice and make their selections. With no time limit, players can take as much time as they need to make their moves and aim for the highest score possible.
